    <h2>Difference Between HTTP1 and HTTP2</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p> <h6> HTTP1</h6> : When we make a request to the server for the guvi.html page, Before sending the request there is a TCP connection between client and server. Again we need to request for the image.img, the connection was not lost after the  first request because we add a keep alive header, there is open connection between the server and client . That means several connection requests & responses are merged in a single connection,  HTTP 1 transfers all the requests & responses in the plain text message form. The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked by all other requests until the response does not receive. all the information related to the header file is repeated in every request. 

        <h6>HTTP2</h6> : The HTTP 2 was created in 2015, It works on the binary framing layer instead of textual converts , It works One TCP connection is used for multiple requests, The Server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the Push frame. It uses HPACK for data compressionâ€¦</p>

        <p>You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal, Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines, The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties (objectName.propertyName) or (objectName["propertyName"])</p>
